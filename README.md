# Woodland-Webgame-my-contributions
My contributions to the Woodland Conservation Webgame I made with a group of 5 using the Agile framework with Jira.

## Technologies used
- HTML, CSS (Tailwind), JavaScript
- Jira and Agile framework

## My contributions
- Implemented the system to change the display when the webpage detects the user has swapped to landscape mode in JavaScript
- Utilized Tailwind CSS to make the webpage pop
- Collaborated via Jira boards and Agile sprints throughout development

## Note
The original group repository is private as per academic policy. This repository showcases my personal work on the project.
